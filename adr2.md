# Family Courts Act, 1984 — **Secs. 9, 10, 11**

## §9 – Duty to make efforts for settlement

* **Core idea:** The Family Court must **endeavour** to assist and persuade the parties to arrive at a settlement and can take help of **counsellors**. Use this to argue that conciliation/mediation is built into family process. ([Indian Kanoon][1])
* **Practical points for a problem question:**

  1. Court must attempt settlement **at the earliest** stage; 2) may adjourn for counselling; 3) if settlement fails, regular trial resumes; 4) settlement recorded has **decree-like** effect. (Use §10(3) read with §9 logic). ([Indian Kanoon][1])

## §10 – Procedure generally

* **Flexibility:** Family Courts can **evolve their own procedure** subject to the Act/Rules; they are **not shackled** by strict CPC/Evidence Act rules (look for “as it thinks fit” language and power to receive evidence otherwise than in accordance with the Evidence Act). This is your hook to justify informal, child-centric processes, affidavits, counsellor notes, etc. ([Indian Kanoon][2])

## §11 – Proceedings in camera

* **Mandate:** If either party asks (or the court thinks fit), proceedings are **in camera**; publication is restricted. Use this when writing on privacy/dignity in matrimonial litigation. ([nyayadegula.kar.nic.in][3])

**Exam tip (FC Act):** A neat 15-marker structure is *Object → §9 conciliation step → counsellors’ role → §10 procedural flexibility (CPC/Evidence relaxations) → §11 privacy → short case/illustration → conclusion on ADR-ethos of family courts*.

---

# National Litigation Policy (NLP)

* **NLP 2010 (DoLA):** Aim—**“less government, more governance”**; Government to be a **responsible and efficient litigant**; screening committees; avoid routine appeals; ADR preference. Quote and move on. ([JGU][4])
* **Vision/NLP 2015 (discussion/vision statement):** Stressed **pre-litigation ADR**, accountability for vexatious litigation, and measurable pendency-reduction. If asked “status,” say 2010 policy exists; later versions are **vision/updates** with states/departments issuing their own SOPs. ([Chambers][5])

**How to use in answers:** When policy questions appear, pair NLP with **§89 CPC** and **Afcons** (below) to argue institutional push toward mediation/conciliation in government disputes.

---

# Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 — **§§7–15 (with leading cases)**

## §7 – Arbitration agreement (AG)

* **Elements:** (i) *Legal relationship*; (ii) *defined legal disputes*; (iii) *AG in writing* (including exchange of letters/pleadings where one party asserts and other **does not deny**); (iv) incorporation by reference possible if clear. ([Scribd][6])
* **What is (not) an “arbitration” clause?**
  **K.K. Modi v. K.N. Modi** — SC listed **attributes** of arbitration: binding decision by a neutral adjudicator, derived from **jurisdictional consent**, following a quasi-judicial process; “friendly adviser”/expert determination language ≠ arbitration. Use this to attack “non-speaking amicable settlement by chairman” clauses. ([Scribd][7])

## §8 – Reference by judicial authority

* **Post-2015**: Mandatory reference **unless** prima facie no AG. Two key cases that examiners love:
  **Hindustan Petroleum v. Pinkcity Midway Petroleums** — once AG exists, civil court must refer; it **cannot** examine merits. Cite for the “mandatory referral” line. ([nearlaw.com][8])
  **P. Anand Gajapathi Raju v. P.V.G. Raju** — laid down the **four conditions** for §8: (i) AG; (ii) action brought to court by a party; (iii) subject-matter covered; (iv) application before first statement on the substance. Good for checklists. ([viamediationcentre.org][9])

## §9 – Interim measures by Court

* **Timing:** Before, during, or after award but before enforcement. Show “intention to arbitrate” when seeking pre-commencement relief; courts often ask the applicant to commence arbitration **within fixed time**. (Use §9 statutory language + general jurisprudence; pair with your fact pattern.) ([viamediationcentre.org][10])

## §10 – Number of arbitrators

* **Text:** Parties free to decide; default = **sole arbitrator**; the section mentions **odd number**. ([legalblogs.wolterskluwer.com][11])
* **MMTC v. Sterlite (1996) 6 SCC 716:** **Even number** of arbitrators **does not** invalidate the AG; §10 is a **machinery** provision—tribunal can still function (e.g., with a presiding umpire/third). Quote this when an opponent pleads “pathological clause.” ([SCC Online][12], [kanoongurus.com][13])

## §11 – Appointment

* **SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering (Const. Bench):** Role under §11 is **judicial** (not administrative); Court can decide **existence/validity** of AG and **prerequisite issues** before appointing. This is big: it controls the gate to arbitration. ([IJCRT][14])
* **NHAI v. Sayedabad Tea Estate (2019):** In land-acquisition compensation disputes, **National Highways Act, 1956 (§3G)** as **lex specialis** **overrides** §11; appointment process there governs. Use this when special statutes prescribe their own arbitrator. ([JGU][4], [Nishith Desai Associates][15])

## §12 – Grounds for challenge; disclosures; **§12(5) + 5th/7th Schedules**

* **Voestalpine v. DMRC (2017):** After the 2015 amendment, **neutrality** is paramount. Govt. bodies can propose a **broad-based panel**, but it must be **diverse and independent**; parties should have a **meaningful choice**; serving employees who are **ineligible** under the 7th Schedule cannot be appointed. Use it to attack one-sided panels. ([CaseMine][16], [Indian Kanoon][17])
* **International Airports Authority v. K.D. Bali (1988)** (bias law generally): The test is **real likelihood** (reasonable apprehension) of bias; applies equally to arbitrators. Handy to tie with §12(3) challenges. ([India Code][18])
* **McLeod Russel v. Aditya Birla Finance (Cal HC, 2023):** Court held **not every unilateral appointment** is void *per se*; ineligibility must map to a **specific 7th Schedule entry**; **waiver** under the **proviso to §12(5)** can cure defects if by **express agreement in writing** (and conduct can amount to waiver in some fact patterns). Use this for nuanced answers alongside TRF/Perkins (contrast!). ([SCC Online][19], [Bar and Bench - Indian Legal news][20])

## §13 – Challenge procedure (before the tribunal)

* **Flow:** Party challenges before the **same tribunal**; if rejected, the remedy is **§34** after award—no immediate appeal. This is a classic trap in exams. ([Scribd][21])

## §14 – Failure or impossibility; **termination of mandate**

* **Grounds:** *De jure*/**de facto** inability, failure to act without undue delay, withdrawal, or agreement of parties. **McLeod Russel** also came as a **§14 petition** to terminate mandate—use it as an illustration. ([Mondaq][22], [Indian Kanoon][2])

## §15 – Substitution

* **Effect:** Substitute arbitrator continues; prior orders can stand unless tribunal decides otherwise; timetable may be adjusted. Connect this with **cases on forfeiture of appointing authority** and **court’s power to step in**. ([IBCLaw][23])

---

# Other key arbitration authorities in your list (use these as **paragraph-length case notes**)

### Afcons Infrastructure Ltd. v. Cherian Varkey Constructions (2010) — §89 CPC & ADR

* Supreme Court curated a **non-exhaustive list** of cases **suitable/unsuitable** for ADR (e.g., family settlements, commercial disputes—suitable; serious fraud, prosecution—unsuitable). Use to justify court-annexed mediation referrals.

### Bihar State Mineral Dev. Corp. v. Encon Builders (2003)

* Read with §§11, 14–15: principles on **appointment**, **substitution**, and when courts will step in due to **default/forfeiture** of appointing authority. The case is a good citation for court’s **residual power** in appointments. ([Indian Kanoon][24])

### V.K. Dewan & Co. v. Delhi Jal Board (SC/Del HC series)

* Useful illustrations on **§11 appointments** and **substitution** when earlier arbitrator withdrew/was ineligible; shows how courts craft appointments to keep the reference alive. (Cite one of the SC orders appointing a sole arbitrator and the Del HC follow-ups.) ([India Code][25])

### National Research Development Corp. v. **Synthite** Industrial Chemicals (P) Ltd.

* (Often mis-cited as “Synthetic”). Principle: **named arbitrator** clauses and whether an office-holder may **continue after demitting office** if he has **entered on the reference**; supports continuity/substitution reasoning under §§14–15. ([CaseMine][16])

### MMTC Ltd. v. Sterlite Industries (1996)

* Re-state the **even-number clause not fatal** point under §10; courts treat §10 as **directory** vis-à-vis validity of the **agreement**, not as a guillotine. ([SCC Online][12])

---

# Quick “apply-in-exam” checklists

## “Is this an arbitration agreement?” (use for §7 prompts)

1. **Writing?** (letters, emails, pleadings)
2. **Defined disputes?** (not just “friendly advisor decides”) → *K.K. Modi* factors.
3. **Intention to be bound by a neutral’s decision?**
4. **Incorporation by reference clear?** ([Scribd][6])

## “Court should refer under §8?”

* Verify the **four P. Anand conditions** and cite **Pinkcity** for mandatory referral; only a **prima facie** look at AG’s existence/validity. ([viamediationcentre.org][9], [nearlaw.com][8])

## “Appointment fight under §11?”

* **SBP & Co.** → judicial function; court can decide existence/validity.
* Check **special statute override** (e.g., **NHAI–§3G**).
* If appointing authority defaulted → **forfeiture** and **court steps in**; then **§15 substitution** flows. ([IJCRT][14], [JGU][4])

## “Bias / ineligibility challenge under §12(5)”

* Map facts to a **specific 7th Schedule entry**; insist on **disclosures**; use **Voestalpine** (panel must be broad/independent) + **K.D. Bali** (real likelihood of bias). Consider **waiver** (proviso) if there’s **express written agreement** or conduct pointing to it (as in **McLeod Russel**). ([CaseMine][16], [Indian Kanoon][17], [India Code][18], [SCC Online][19])

## “Even number of arbitrators clause”

* Argue **validity of AG intact** (MMTC); court may cure machinery by appointing a **presiding arbitrator**/treating clause as directory. ([SCC Online][12])

---

# Likely 10–15 mark prompts (given your pattern)

1. **“Explain §§7–8 of the A\&C Act with case law.”**
   **Skeleton:** §7 ingredients → *K.K. Modi* attributes → §8 mandatory referral → *P. Anand* checklist → *Pinkcity* “must refer” → 2–3 lines contrasting *SBP* (court’s threshold role).

2. **“Discuss neutrality of arbitrators after the 2015 amendments.”**
   **Skeleton:** §12(1) disclosures; §12(5)+7th Schedule bright-line ineligibility → *Voestalpine* (panel breadth/independence) → *K.D. Bali* bias test → **McLeod Russel** nuance on unilateral appointments/waiver. ([CaseMine][16], [Indian Kanoon][17], [India Code][18], [SCC Online][19])

3. **“NHAI v. Sayedabad Tea Estate—discuss lex specialis vs A\&C Act.”**
   **Skeleton:** Facts (land acquisition compensation; delay in appointment) → Holding: **NH Act §3G overrides §11**; appointing power & forfeiture analysis → Implication for other special statutes. ([JGU][4], [Nishith Desai Associates][15])

4. **“Family Courts Act §§9–11 embody ADR—explain.”**
   **Skeleton:** §9 settlement duty (+ counsellors) → §10 flexible procedure → §11 privacy → policy rationale (NLP + Afcons). ([Indian Kanoon][1], [nyayadegula.kar.nic.in][3], [JGU][4])

---

# One-page memory hooks

* **§7** “**WIND**”: *Writing – Intention – (Narrow) Dispute defined – Derives binding award*. (*K.K. Modi* filter for “A, not E” i.e., Arbitration, not Expert.) ([Scribd][7])
* **§8** “**MAPS**”: *Mandatory referral – AG exists – Parties before court – Subject-matter covered*. (from *P. Anand*). ([viamediationcentre.org][9])
* **§12(5)** “**RWD**”: *Relationships (7th Schedule) – Written waiver – Disclosures continuous*. (Use *Voestalpine*.) ([CaseMine][16])
* **§10** “**EO ≠ IV**”: *Even number **≠** Invalid* (MMTC). ([SCC Online][12])
* **FC Act** “**C-FP**”: *Conciliate (§9) – Flexible procedure (§10) – Privacy (§11)*. ([Indian Kanoon][1], [nyayadegula.kar.nic.in][3])

## 3. **Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 – Sections 7–15**

### §7 – Arbitration Agreement

* **Concept**: Writing, intention to adjudicate, incorporation by reference.
* **Case**: *K.K. Modi v. K.N. Modi* – Distinguishes true arbitration (binding decision from tribunal) from expert determination/counselling. (You use it to argue that advisory-only clauses don’t establish §7 AG.)

### §8 – Mandatory Court Referral

* **Concept**: Court must refer to arbitration if AG exists and litigation invoked prematurely.
* **Case**: *Hindustan Petroleum v. Pinkcity* – Civil court **must** refer, cannot probe merits; reinforces the mandatory nature. *P. Anand Gajapathi Raju v. P.V.G. Raju* – spells out 4-point checklist.

### §9 – Interim Measures

* **Concept**: Courts can grant interim relief even before constitution of tribunal, but expect arbitration initiation.
* **Use**: Tactical use to prompt counterpart to start arbitration or get stay.

### §10 – Number of Arbitrators

* **Concept**: Party autonomy; even-numbered clause not fatal to AG.
* **Case**: *MMTC v. Sterlite (1996)* – §10 is **directory**, not mandatory; invalidity of AG based on even number is not tenable.

### §11 – Appointment of Arbitrators

* **Concept**: Court’s role is *judicial*, not administrative; can step in when parties default.
* **Case**: *S.B.P. & Co. v. Patel Engineering* – Appointment under §11 is judicial; courts can decide threshold validity issues.
* **Special Statute Override**: *NHAI v. Sayedabad Tea Estate (2019)* – Where **lex specialis** applies (e.g., NH Act §3G), it overrides §11; arbitration appointment protocol differs.

### §§12(1) & 12(5) + 7th Schedule – Independence & Bias

* **Concept**: Arbitrators must be neutral; certain relationships render them ineligible; parties may waive.
* **Case 1 (Voestalpine v. DMRC, 2017)** – SC held retired government employees are **not automatically** disqualified; bias can't be presumed; panels must be **broad-based** to protect neutrality. (\[turn0search2], \[turn0search6])
* **Case 2 (K.D. Bali)** – Real likelihood of bias test applies to arbitrators.
* **Nuance (McLeod Russel v. Aditya Birla Fin.) (2023)** – Court held waiver (even by conduct) under proviso to §12(5) can cure defects if written or evidenced; not every unilateral appointment is void per se.

### §13 – Challenge Process

* **Concept**: Challenge goes before the tribunal itself; if rejected, remedy via §34 post-award.

### §14 – Termination of Mandate

* **Concept**: Chairs/resignee, delay, inability or withdrawal are grounds; mandatory when arbitrator incapable.
* **Case**: *Bihar State Mineral Dev. Corp. v. Encon Builders* – Illustrates when courts step in due to default/forfeiture of appointing authority.

### §15 – Substitution

* **Concept**: Replacement arbitrator is appointed; prior proceedings can continue; ensures continuity.

## **How to Use in Exam Answers**

1. **Start with Section**: E.g., “Under §12(5) read with the 7th Schedule, arbitrator must be free from disqualifying relationships…”
2. **Introduce Concept**: Neutrality, independence, party autonomy, judicial minimalism, etc.
3. **Cite Case**: *Voestalpine* – neutrality not presumed if retired public servant; bias must be proven (makes argument stronger).
4. **Add Nuance**: *McLeod Russel* – waiver can cure; parties autonomy alive post-2015 amendment.
5. **Wrap with Implication**: Ensures fairness and party choice, reduces litigation about arbitrators.
